 <h1> The Basics: </h1>
 <p> The first thing you need to learn about cooking is safety. If you are not safe cooking can be very dangerous
  if you don't know how to clean or hold a knife correctly. Here are some general safety tips about cooking. </p>
 
 <ul>
  <li> When frying, grilling, boiling or broiling food,always stay inside of the kitchen and watch carefully.</li>
  <li> Make sure flammables are away from anything can can create fire, such as a stove top.</li>
  <li> When using oil make sure you add the food gently to the pot, so the oil doesn't splatter.</li>
  <li> Make sure you keep an eye on what you fry. If you see wisps of smoke or the oil smells,immediately turn off the burner 
   and/or carefully remove the pan from the burner. Smoke is a danger sign that the oil is too hot.</li>
 </ul>
