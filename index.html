   <p> I like to cook and this is a site about cooking.
    
 <h1> The Basics: </h1>
 <p> The first thing you need to learn about cooking is safety. If you are not safe cooking can be very dangerous
  if you don't know how to clean or hold a knife correctly. Here are some general safety tips about cooking. </p>
 
 <ul>
  <li> When frying, grilling, boiling or broiling food,always stay inside of the kitchen and watch carefully.</li>
  <li> Make sure flammables are away from anything can can create fire, such as a stove top.</li>
  <li> When using oil make sure you add the food gently to the pot, so the oil doesn't splatter.</li>
  <li> Make sure you keep an eye on what you fry. If you see wisps of smoke or the oil smells,immediately turn off the burner 
   and/or carefully remove the pan from the burner. Smoke is a danger sign that the oil is too hot.</li>
 </ul>
  <p> Next up are some cooking techniques, since I am more of a person that specializes in French cooking this list will
   be more geared towards French techniques.
<h1> Cooking techniques...
<ul> 
 <li> Bouquet Garni, a blend of herbs usually used in soup and stew.</li>
 <li> Chiffonade,finely chopped leaves like spinach or something.</li>
 <li> Coulis, a sauce that is very colorful and can dazzle some deserts.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 this might not be a lot but those are the only ones I know.
